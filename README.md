Cancer Relevant Annotations Bin (CRAB)
============================================================

Overview
===========================
CRAB is a collection of data from a variety of cancer databases that
has been parsed and summarized into BED or VCF file formats to be used easily
with vcfanno for the annotation of VCF files. CRAB was designed to be 
used alongside Cancer-GEMINI, but provides a useful resource that can be useful
in other applications.
